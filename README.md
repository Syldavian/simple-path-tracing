# simple-path-tracing

This repository contains my implementation of the Path Tracing algorithm. This is a final project for the course *Fundamentals of Computer Graphics*, Tsinghua University, 2021 spring.

## Quick Start

To execute this project, Ubuntu 20.04 + CMake is required. Open the command line terminal and run: 

```
bash ./code/run_all.sh
```

Then the project would compile and render 3 different images, as shown in `./results/`

directory.
